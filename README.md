# React Native 'this' is undefined Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where the keyword `this` is used incorrectly within a functional component.  The error, 'this.setState is not a function', typically arises when developers try to use class component methods (like `setState`) inside a functional component.

## The Problem
Functional components in React (and React Native) do not have their own `this` context.  Class components have `this` to access internal state and methods, but functional components do not. 

## The Solution
The solution involves switching to functional components with Hooks or using class components (if the state management is complex and hooks add unnecessary complexity). The example provides both solutions for comparison.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
